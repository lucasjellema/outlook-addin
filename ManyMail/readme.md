This Addin is activated when reading a message.

The current message can be sent to a list of recipients - and can be personalized before it is sent.

The Addin opens a new message form for every recipient, with the personalized to, subject and message body in the form.

In the desktop client, you have to send each mail message manually. In the web client, there is an additional automation available: The addin defines a special bcc value: autosend@contoso.com. If you use the Outlook WebClient and you have installed and enabled the Chrome Extension Outlook New Mail Auto Sender, then this value will trigger the automatically sending of the mail message (the extension will locate and click the Send button in the new message form).
